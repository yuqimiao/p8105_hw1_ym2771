# Problem 1

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
## create df1
df1 <- tibble(
    a = rnorm(8),
    b = a > 0,
    c = letters[1:8],
    d = factor(c("a","a","a","b","b","b","c","c"), levels = c("a","b","c"))
)

## calculate mean of each variable in df1
sapply(select(df1, everything()),FUN = mean)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA
    
    ## Warning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ##           a           b           c           d 
    ## -0.09623695  0.50000000          NA          NA

### summary 1

As the outcome shows, numerical variable a and logical variable b can be
applied to mean( ), while character variable c and factor variable d can
not be applied to mean( ).

``` r
## change classes into numerical.
sapply(select(df1, b:d), FUN = as.numeric)
```

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df1, b)) * pull(df1, a)
```

``` r

    ## [7] -0.8218474 -1.2244622

### summary 2

Given to the result, the logical and factor variabls are converted to
numerical var by assigning the levels of catogries with ordering number,
while the character value can not be converted.

As the error shows, the mean() can only take **numerical and logical
variables** as objects to do the maths, while factor and character
variables can not be converted to the corresponding classes in mean
function, yet factor variable can be coverted into numerical and then
calculate average, which may not be an appropriate way to describe
discrete variables.

# Problem 2

``` r
## create df2
df2 <- tibble(
    x = rnorm(500),
    y = rnorm(500),
    z = (x+y) > 1,
    num_z = as.numeric(z),
    fac_z = as.factor(z)
)
```

### Description of df2

  - The size of data frame df2 above is 500 rows \* 5 cols;
  - The mean of x is -0.0031948; the median of x is -0.0584028; and the
    standard deviation of x is 0.9923826;
  - The propotion of cases which (x+y) \> 1 is 0.242.

### plotting section

``` r
ggplot(df2, aes(x, y, color = z)) + geom_point()

### Comment on color scale

  - As shown in the plot, the color scale for logical and factor
    variables are assigned by the **categories**, which means different
    categories have different colors.

  - While for numerical variables, color scale is assigned by the
    **quantile** of the variable by default, which means that the data
    of numerical variable was cut into 5 categories according to the
    quantile, and the 5 color is categorized from dark to light
    according to the absolute number of boundary of categories changing
    from minimum to maximum.
